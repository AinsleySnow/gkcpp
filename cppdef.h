 * host operating systems and target configurations.
 *
 * NOTE: cpp assumes it is compiled by a compiler that supports macros
 * with arguments.  If this is not the case (as for Decus C), #define
 * nomacarg -- and provide function equivalents for all macros.
 *
 * (Is there any C compiler that doesn't support macros with arguments?)
 * ï¼ˆAlas. Tears of the era.)
 * 
 * cpp also assumes the host and target implement the Ascii character set.
 * If this is not the case, you will have to do some editing here and there.
 * 
 * (...Or any host or target that totally ignores ASCII?)
 * (Tears again.)

 *	The above may be #defined as "" if they are not wanted.
 *	They should not be #defined as NULL.

 *
 * OK_DOLLAR	Should be set true if $ is a valid alphabetic character
 *		in identifiers (default), or zero if $ is invalid.

 *		have a machine where sizeof (signed int) differs from
 *		sizeof (unsigned int), you will have to edit code and
 *		tables in cpp3.c (and extend the -S option definition.)
