This is a C preprocessor for Ginkgo. It is based on Frexx CPP by Daniel Stenberg which supports ANSI C. I forked this project and will update it to C23. I have already implemented \_\_VA\_ARGS\_\_ and \_\_VA\_OPT\_\_, and I will implement other C23 features in the future.

The original README content is as below.

Frexx CPP (C Preprocessor)

Copyright (c) by Daniel Stenberg 1993 - 2011

This is a C preprocessor. It is a project based on public domain code, then
forked by Daniel in 1993 and future work has been done under a BSD license.

The C preprocessor is now (mostly?) ANSI C compliant, and some tweaks have
been applied to also make it fairly usable to process other data files, such
as HTML for simple web sites.
